          and output data as well as any expected errors or requirements.
          Basically this description (with some examples) here are a few
          examples of what that page should look like (in terms of content)

        <td>/Users</td>
        <td>

          with all their properties
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>POST</td>
        <td>/User</td>
        <td>

            properties if it exists.
            If the User ID is not found it should return an error 404 (Not Found) with an
            appropriate message
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
